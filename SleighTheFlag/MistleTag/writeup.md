You are given an image. There is something hidden in it, I don't remember if I solved it or not but I'll leave it as it is.

## Solution

- Use ```exiftool``` or [Aperi'Solve](https://www.aperisolve.com/0868aeb9cb6be454e9409b6396daf6ab) to read the metadata of the image to obtain the flag.

- The flag is ```SLEIGH{ex1f_m3t4d4t4_1s_fun}```
