## Description

A hush fell over the North Pole… then a whisper reached Santa’s ear. “The Grinch has slipped in,” an Elf breathed. “A curious parcel holds the vault’s secret.” 

Among jingles and sleigh chatter, one quiet thread hums the truth. Follow the whisper, not the bells—only the attentive can reclaim the lost key.
