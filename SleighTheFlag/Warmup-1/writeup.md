# Captain we are lost!

Only the jpeg image given. It shows some sort of a pattern that needs to be decoded for the flag.

## Solution

- These are International Code of Signals (ICS) nautical flags, each one representing a letter. If you decode them left → right, the sequence spells:
```T H E A N C H O R```

- How it maps
    - **T**ango
    - **H**otel
    - **E**cho
    - **||**
    - **A**lfa
    - **N**ovember
    - **C**harlie
    - **H**otel
    - **O**scar
    - **R**omeo

- Therefor the flag is ```SLEIGH{THE_ANCHOR}```
