# Admin's Lazy Day

You are given a website under this [link](https://glittering-gaufre-a43545.netlify.app/). Inspect and any dev tools blocked.

---

## Solution

- As the first step I have visited this website and the inspection tool was blocked, the description
indicated that the flag is hidden in the source code (As they mentioned lazy).

- I have clicked, SHIFT+U to get the source code and in the last bit, the flag was visible.
