# Frame by Frame, Colour by Colour

You are given a gif, the flag is encoded somewhere in the gif. It's extremely difficult to find and yet to be solved.

## Description

A simple GIF from a holiday trip… or is it? 🌍

Mr. Bean pedals calmly through the scene 🚲, looping endlessly, frame after frame 🖼️.
The animation looks innocent, plays smoothly, and reveals nothing obvious at first glance.
No readable strings. No useful metadata. No visible corruption.

But GIFs are more than just pictures.

They are moments stitched together ⏱️, colors chosen from a limited set 🎨, and numbers masquerading as pixels 🔢.
Not every frame tells a story — some can be skipped.
Not every color is what it appears to be — sometimes the index matters more than the shade.

Somewhere between the repetitions of that bicycle ride, a message survived reconstruction, repetition, and optimization 🔁.

If you understand how GIFs really work,
the aftermath will speak for itself 🧠.

Flag format: AFTERMATH{...} 🚩
